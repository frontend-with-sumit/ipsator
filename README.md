# Assignment - Product listing page
A responsive UI design for the product listing page.

## Tech Stack
- React
- Next.js
- TypeScript
- TailwindCSS
- Mock API = dummyjson.com

## Considerations
Due to the limitation of the mock API, search within a particular category couldn't be achieved. However, search using product name is working perfectly fine.

## Running the project
- Clone the project
```
git clone https://github.com/frontend-with-sumit/ipsator.git
```

- Install the dependencies
```
npm install
```

- Start server
```
npm run dev
```
